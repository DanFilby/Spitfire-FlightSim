# Spitfire-FlightSim
This repo contains a simple game, made in C++ using opengl, of a spitfire flying around a basic level. The game's purpose was to introduce myself to low-level graphics and engine concepts.

The level contains a procedurally generated terrain, created on starupl, and a skybox. The camera follows the plane, which the player control with the key arrows for direction and num keys (4,5,6,8) for rotations.

Use of proper areo-dynamic physics is something I will get around to adding
